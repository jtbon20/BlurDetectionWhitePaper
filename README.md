### Abstract
Motion blur, one of the biggest problems for feature-based
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems, causes
inaccuracies and location losses during tracking. This paper evaluates the
runtime and accuracy of top blur detection methods during use with SLAM
in factory conditions. It was found that Modified Sum of Laplacian method
performs the best overall. Based on its low computational requirement and
high precision, it is the best solution for real-time, onboard SLAM
applications.
